This project is about designing a Library Management System using MySQL. It includes tables for books, members, categories, and book issues. The goal is to build a clean, relational database that helps track which member has which book and manage categories.

Tables Used

Table	What It Stores

Category	Different categories of books (e.g., Fiction, Science)
Book	Book details like title, author, ISBN, and status
Member	Member information like name, email, and phone
Issue	Records of which book is issued to which member

Relationships Between Tables:

Every book is linked to a category.

Every issue record connects a book with a member.

A member can borrow multiple books (many issues).

ER Diagram:

Below is a diagram that shows how the tables are connected (relationships and keys):
